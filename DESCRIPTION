Description: The rheroicons provides access to the fantastic SVG icon
    collection heroicons, originally developed by Adam Wathan and
    Steve Schoger at Tailwind Labs, as R functions for use in your
    web-based projects (i.e., shiny Rmarkdown, etc.). All icons are
    rendered as inline SVG elements. Therefore no HTML, CSS, or
    JavaScript dependencies are loaded into your app.
